## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This Frontend Mentor challenge was the simplest one yet, but there is the opportunity to learn even in the simplest tasks. I improved my skills in choosing the correct size units to create a truly responsive website, learned how to make beautiful buttons that work consistently across browsers, and used the transparent keyword as a value for the first time.

### Continued development

I would love to learn how to create enticing animations for buttons, and I plan to spend some time doing that in my next project.
