## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This Frontend Mentor challenge was the simplest one yet, but even in the simplest tasks there is the opportunity to learn. I improved my skills on choosing the correct size units to create a true responsive website, learned how to create beautiful buttons that work consistently accross browsers and got to use the `transparent` keyword as a value.

### Continued development

I would love to learn how to create enticing animations for buttons, and I am planning on spending some time doing that in a next project.
